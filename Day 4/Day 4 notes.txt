-There are two types of type conversion in Python.
    1. Implicit Conversion - automatic type conversion
    2. Explicit Conversion - manual type conversion


#Both lines have unnecessary leading spaces, which causes Python to raise 
an IndentationError when the code is not inside a function, class, or conditional block.

#What is Indentation?
Indentation refers to the spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line. In Python, indentation is not just for readability—it's part of the syntax and defines code blocks.

#Why Python Uses Indentation
Python uses indentation to define:
    Function bodies
    Class definitions
    Loop blocks (for, while)
    Conditional blocks (if, else, elif)
    Try-except blocks
