#variables:
 -variable are symbolic names that refer to objects or values stored in your computer memory
 -Python Syntax
variable_name = value

Examples of Variables:
>>> word = "Python"

>>> number = 42

>>> coefficient = 2.87

>>> fruits = ["apple", "mango", "grape"]

>>> ordinals = {1: "first", 2: "second", 3: "third"}

>>> class SomeCustomClass: pass
>>> instance = SomeCustomClass()

#Expressions:
- an expression is a simple statement that python can evaluate to produce and return a value
- Each of these expressions represents a specific computation. To build the expressions, you’ve used values and the multiplication operator (*). Python evaluates each expression and returns the resulting value.	

#a same variable can have multiple value which will not be replaced. 

#Key point:
- Lists remember the order you put items in
- Index starts at 0 (first item is [0], second is [1], etc.)
- You decide what to print by using the index or a loop


#Literals:
A literal is the actual value written directly in your code. It's the raw data you type.

Examples of literals:
42           # integer literal
3.14         # float literal
"Hello"      # string literal
True         # boolean literal
[1, 2, 3]    # list literal


#Key differences:
Literals                                Values
Written directly in code                Can be in variables or from expressions
Fixed/constant                          Can change
42, "hello", TrueResult of x + y,       what's stored in a variable

#Literal = what you type in your code
#Value = what actually exists in memory

#Loop Variables
Loop variables help you process data during iteration in for loops and sometimes in while loops. 
In a for loop, the variable takes the value of the current element in the input iterable each time you go through the loop.
