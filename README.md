# Python- Course 
This is Python course learning from basic to advance. 

I am learning from different platforms:
  1. https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/getting-started
  2. https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/python-for-everybody/python-for-everybody/introduction-why-program
  3. https://www.learnpython.org/

also from a different YouTube channel.

I am using Claude as my AI support tool.
