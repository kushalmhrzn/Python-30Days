#Data types 
    - is a type of data.
    - informs what operations can be performed on a particular set of data.

#string
    - Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
    - exmaple
        'hello' and "hello" are same
    
    -string always start form 0

#strings are arrays 
    - strings in Python are arrays of unicode characters.However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
    - exmaple:
        a = "Hello, World!"
        print(a[1])

    
#Looping Through a String
    -Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.
    -example:
        for x in "banana":
        print (x)

    output:
    b
    a
    n
    a
    n
    a

#String Length
    -To get the length of a string, use the len() function.

#Check String
    -To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.
    -Example
    --Check if "free" is present in the following text:
        txt = "The best things in life are free!"
        print("free" in txt)
